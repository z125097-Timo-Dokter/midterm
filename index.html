                            I am a game-development student with a passion for
                            creating immersive experiences. I have a strong
                            foundation in programming, game design, and 3D
                            modeling. I am always eager to learn new
                            technologies and improve my skills.

                                Ant game is a 3D game which I made with a group
                                of other students for a school project. For this
                                project I was mainly responsible for the
                                movement mechanics of the player and for the AI
                                of the ant queen. The game is made in Unity.

                                The Dutchband Banddesigner is a web application
                                where you can customize and order bracelets for
                                festivals. The entire application was made using
                                Django, which is a python framework, and the
                                designer part of the applicaton was made in
                                React.

                                I am running my own DnD campaign for a group of
                                friends. It may not seem all that interesting to
                                put on my portfolio, but I think I have learned
                                a lot and I have improved my skills in
                                storytelling and thinking on the fly. And I have
                                practiced my worldbuilding skills a lot. As well
                                as a lot of different skills that can be usefull
                                to any kind of game developer.

                                to get the data from the file. After that we had
                                to display a random quote when the button was
                                pressed.

                                would display the questions and let the user
                                answer them. After the user answered all the
                                questions, the app would display the score.
